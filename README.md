# Breast Cancer Diagnosis using Machine Learning
Breast cancer is one of the most prevalent and life-threatening diseases among women globally. In this project, the goal is to develop a machine learning solution that can accurately classify breast tumors as either malignant or benign based on a dataset of real-valued features extracted from cell nuclei.

Background:
- Breast cancer is characterized by the presence of abnormal cell growth in breast tissues.
- Biopsy data, including cell nucleus features, can provide valuable information for diagnosing breast
cancer.
- Machine learning models can help automate the diagnosis process, providing quick and accurate
results.

Challenge:
1. ID number: A unique identifier for each biopsy.
2. Diagnosis (M = malignant, B = benign): The ground truth label indicating whether the tumour is
malignant or benign.
3. Ten real-valued features (a to j): Computed measurements from cell nuclei, including
characteristics such as radius, texture, perimeter, area, smoothness, compactness, concavity, concave
points, symmetry, and fractal dimension.
